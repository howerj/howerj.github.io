	<h3>H2 SoC</h3>
	<p>
		The <a href="https://github.com/howerj/forth-cpu">H2 FPGA SoC</a>
		is a CPU written in VHDL for a Spartan-6 Xilinx FPGA, it
		executes Forth directly and is based on the J1 Forth CPU. A
		video below shows its operation, accepting commands via a
		keyboard and displaying the results on a VGA monitor.

	<h3>liblisp</h3>
	<p>
		<a href="https://github.com/howerj/liblisp">liblisp</a> is a
		lisp interpreter written in C. Which includes a module system
		so that DLLs (under Windows) and Shared Objects (under Linux)
		can be loaded in at run time.
	</p>

	<h3>dbcc</h3>
	<p>
		<a href="https://github.com/howerj/dbcc">DBCC</a> is a utility
		for turning a DBC file into some C code that can parse and

		XML description of the messages.
	</p>

	<h3>gladiators</h3>

	<p>
		<a href="https://github.com/howerj/gladiators">gladiators</a>

	<h3>My CV</h3>

	<p>
		My CV is available <a href="https://github.com/howerj/CV">here</a>, I

	</p>

	<h3>Mouse Jiggle</h3>
	<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/howerj/mouse-jiggle">Mouse Jiggle</a> is an
	AutoHotkey script for keeping a Windows machine from sleeping by moving
	the mouse cursor.
	</p>

	<h3>NVRAM</h3>
	<p> <a href="https://github.com/howerj/nvram">NVRAM</a> is a concept
	project to show you how you can use the linker to automatically save
	variables to disk on program exit and load them at start up, without
	treating them specially or with extra serialization/deserialization
	steps. Doxygen is then used to extract which variables are saved to
	disk and Perl is called to automatically generate an editor for NVRAM
	dump. This concept is useful in an embedded system, where portability
	is not a concern. </p>
